description: '"On the night of February 27, 1917, when the Laconia was two hundred
  miles off the coast of Ireland, the Gibbons'' "hunch" was fulfilled. The Laconia
  was torpedoed and sunk. After a perilous night in a small boat on the open sea,
  Gibbons was rescued and brought into Queenstown. He opened the cables and flashed
  to America the most powerful call to arms to the American people. It shook the country.
  It was the testimony of an eye witness and it convinced the Imperial German government,
  beyond all reasonable doubt, of the wilful and malicious murder of American citizens.
  The Gibbons story furnished the proof of the overt act and it was unofficially admitted
  at Washington that it was the determining factor in sending America into the war
  one month later" -- Foreword.'
